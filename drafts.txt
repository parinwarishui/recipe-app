Cake - {fruits2} CAKE (adapted from Carrot Cake: https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/carrot-cake)

230ml {vegetables1} oil
100g natural yogurt
4 large eggs
1½ tsp vanilla extract
½ {fruits1}, zested
265g {grains1} flour
335g {seasoning1}
2½ tsp {seasoning2}
¼ fresh {nuts1}, finely grated
265g {fruits2}, grated
100g {fruits3}
100g {nuts2}, roughly chopped

100g slightly salted butter, softened
300g {seasoning3}
100g {seasoning4}

STEP 1
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. 
Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. 
Whisk the {vegetables1} oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. Mix the flour, {seasoning1}, {seasoning2} and {nuts1} with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. 
Squeeze any lumps of {seasoning1} through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.

STEP 2
Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the {fruits2}, {fruits3} and half the {nuts2}. 
Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins.

STEP 3
Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. 
If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. 
Leave to cool in the tins.

STEP 4
To make the icing, beat the butter and {seasoning3} together until smooth. 
Add half the {seasoning4} and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). 
Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing. 
Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining {nuts2}. 
Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Best eaten at room temperature.
