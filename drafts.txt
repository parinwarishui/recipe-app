Cake - {fruits2} CAKE (adapted from Carrot Cake: https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/carrot-cake)

230ml {vegetables1} oil
100g natural yogurt
4 large eggs
1½ tsp vanilla extract
½ {fruits1}, zested
265g {grains1} flour
335g {seasoning1}
2½ tsp {seasoning2}
¼ fresh {nuts1}, finely grated
265g {fruits2}, grated
100g {fruits3}
100g {nuts2}, roughly chopped

100g slightly salted butter, softened
300g {seasoning3}
100g {seasoning4}

STEP 1
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. 
Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. 
Whisk the {vegetables1} oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. Mix the flour, {seasoning1}, {seasoning2} and {nuts1} with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. 
Squeeze any lumps of {seasoning1} through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.

STEP 2
Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the {fruits2}, {fruits3} and half the {nuts2}. 
Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins.

STEP 3
Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. 
If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. 
Leave to cool in the tins.

STEP 4
To make the icing, beat the butter and {seasoning3} together until smooth. 
Add half the {seasoning4} and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). 
Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing. 
Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining {nuts2}. 
Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Best eaten at room temperature.

1l hot {meat1} stock
1 {vegetables3}

######

pie - {fruits1} pie

300g {grains1} flour
200g cold salted butter, cut into cubes
1 tsp {fruits2} vinegar
1 egg, beaten
{seasoning1}
1.2kg {fruits1} peeled, stoned and cut into chunks
150g {seasoning2}
60g {grains2} flour, plus extra for dusting
1 {fruits3}, juiced
20g {nuts1}, peeled and sliced

STEP 1
Tip the flour into a large bowl and toss with the butter. 
Mix the butter into the flour using two forks until you have medium lumps of butter 
coated in flour. Add the vinegar, then slowly add 120ml ice-cold water, 1 tbsp at a time, 
mixing well until you have a shaggy dough.

STEP 2
Turn the dough out onto a surface and fold it onto itself a few times until you have a 
pliable dough with streaks of butter throughout. If it feels dry, dampen your hands lightly 
and continue to fold. If it’s sticky, sprinkle over a little more flour. When it’s cohesive, 
divide it in two and flatten into discs. Wrap and chill for 2 hrs, or overnight.

STEP 3
For the filling, combine the {fruits1}, {seasoning2}, {grains2} flour, {fruits3} juice and {nuts1} in a large bowl.

STEP 4
Roll out each pastry disc into a 30cm circle on a lightly floured surface. 
Use one to line a 23cm pie dish, smoothing it to the edges. Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.

STEP 5
Cut the second pastry circle into 12 x 2.5cm-wide strips using a pizza cutter.
Weave the strips into a lattice by arranging six vertically parallel to each other on a board 
or sheet of baking parchment with a space between each. Partially fold back alternate strips, 
then lay another horizontally across the top, near the folds. Flip the folded strips back over 
to cover the horizontal ones. Repeat with the process, alternating which vertical strips are 
folded down each time.

STEP 6
Pour the filling into the pastry case. Brush some beaten egg over the edge of the pie crust, 
then top with the lattice, press around the edge to seal, then crimp using a fork. 
Brush over the rest of the egg, then sprinkle over the {seasoning1}.

STEP 7
Bake at 220C/200C fan/gas 7 for 30 mins, then turn the oven down to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 for 45 mins more, 
loosely covering with foil if it gets too dark. Leave to cool for 1 hr so the juices can set before slicing.

pizza - {adjectives1} {meats1} pizza

10g fresh yeast or 7g sachet dried
½ tsp sugar
375g {grains1} flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tbsp {vegetables1} oil, plus extra for greasing
375g {meats1}
fresh {vegetables3}, to serve
3 tbsp {vegetables2} oil
1 {fruits1}, chopped
1 {fruits3}, crushed
2 x 400g cans good-quality Italian chopped {fruits2}

STEP 1
Mix together the yeast and sugar with 250ml warm water and leave to sit for 10 mins. 
Place half the flour in a table-top mixer with a dough hook, pour in the yeast mixture 
and beat at medium speed for 10 mins (or mix in a bowl, then knead with oiled hands in 
the bowl for 5-10 mins).

STEP 2
Leave somewhere warm for 10 more mins, then add the remaining flour and oil. 
Beat or knead to a dough for a further 5 mins. Put in a well-oiled bowl, 
cover with a cloth and place somewhere warm to double in size – about 1½ hrs.

STEP 3
For the sauce, heat the {vegetables2} oil in a pan over a moderate heat. 
Add the {fruits1} and cook for 3 mins, stirring constantly. 
Add the {fruits3}, 1 tsp sea salt and 1 tsp ground black pepper and cook for 2 mins more. 
Add the {fruits2} and bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for a good 
20 mins, stirring occasionally.

STEP 4
Once your dough has doubled in size, slap it down on a lightly floured surface and knead 
for 4 mins until soft but not too elastic. Divide into 6 pieces, roll into balls and leave to rest for 10 mins. 
Heat oven to the highest temperature possible (270C fan in the Good Food test kitchen) 
and place a flat baking sheet in the oven.

STEP 5
With a well-floured rolling pin, roll out each ball of dough as thinly as possible. 
Remove the baking sheet from the oven, oil or dust with flour, then carefully transfer the dough base onto it. 
Spread over some of the {fruits2} sauce (I like to apply it in the quantity that you would spread Marmite on toast, 
or the base will be soft and fall to bits), then the {meats1} and any toppings you desire.

STEP 6
Cook for between 5-10 mins depending on your oven temp, 
until the base is crisp and the {meats1} cooked. Scatter with {vegetables3}.

Heat the remaining oil and butter in the pan and add the onions. 
Fry gently for 15 mins or until golden brown and caramelised. 
Add the garlic, {fruits2}, {seasoning1}, {seasoning2}, {seasoning3} and {seasoning4}
and fry for two mins. Tip in the {fruits1}, stock and sugar and bring to the simmer.

for 1 ½ – 2 hrs or until the meat is tender and falling apart. 
Remove the lid for the last 20 minutes of cooking.

STEP 4
Stir through the garam masala and cream (if using) and season to taste. 
Scatter over the {vegetables1} and serve with naan breads or rice.
